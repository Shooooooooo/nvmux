//! Shared by the integration test files.

//! Both suites need something the machine may not have — a usable `nvim`, an
//! ssh host that answers — and skip rather than fail without it, so a laptop
//! without one still runs the rest. In CI a skip is a silent no-op, which is
//! why `$NVMUX_TEST_REQUIRE` exists: a comma-separated list of what must be
//! present (`nvim`, `ssh`), turning the skip for each into a failure.
